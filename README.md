# Getting Around It!

This is a Python program using Pygame for visualization, implementing pathfinding algorithms to navigate through a grid.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation
1. Ensure Python is installed. If not, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install Pygame by running:
    ```
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.
3. Run the program using Python:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
4. Click on the grid cells to place the start point, end point, and barriers.
5. Press the spacebar to start the pathfinding algorithm.
6. Press 'c' to clear the grid and start over.

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Contains the main code for the pathfinding visualization.
- `config.py`: Configuration file storing constants like grid dimensions.
- `README.md`: Provides information about the program.

## Notes
- Left-click to set the start point, end point, and barriers.
- Right-click to clear a cell.
- The program implements the A* search algorithm for pathfinding.
